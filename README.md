## ðŸ“‚ Featured Project: Case Study

### Project: Chimera Aggregate
*Self-Directed | June 2022 â€“ Present*

This is a multi-year, self-directed research and development project to architect a complex, rule-based conceptual system from the ground up.

* **System Architecture & Documentation:** Architected a complex conceptual framework ('Chimera Aggregate') and authored over 2.47 million words of comprehensive technical documentation, including process flows and rule-set definitions.

* **Quality Assurance & Analysis:** Performed continuous QA on conceptual models to identify and resolve thousands of logical flaws and data continuity errors; conducted root cause analysis to trace systemic issues back to foundational rule conflicts.

* **System Design & Modeling:** Established a hierarchical rule-based system to ensure internal consistency. Developed a detailed data taxonomy to govern entity interactions and simulated multi-stage life cycles to validate long-term system stability.
