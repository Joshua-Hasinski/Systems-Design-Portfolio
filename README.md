### Meticulous and analytical Systems Designer with three years of experience architecting, documenting, and performing quality assurance on a complex, rule-based conceptual project.

Welcome to my portfolio. This repository serves as the central hub for my professional work. Below you will find my resume and the primary case study for my work in complex systems architecture.

    * *A deep dive into the foundational architecture, rule-based logic, and conceptual framework of the system.*

* [**Case Study 2: Quality Assurance & State Contradiction**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/103SATuzl5QPPiXLEV8hl5OYySHdjJV6r8hCfTNAxtSw/edit?usp=sharing)
  * *An analysis of the QA process used to identify and resolve thousands of logical flaws, including a specific example of a critical state contradiction.*

* [**Case Study 3: Data Taxonomy & Modeling**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AhRd8gCef3tT3JdLA0Z2XfpCvaO8XthJHfxGRl8jPzU/edit?usp=sharing)
    * *Details the creation of a hierarchical taxonomy to classify all system entities and govern their interactions.*

* [**Case Study 4: Procedural Generation Logic**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OYjXW3JBXlLfeXfipmv-NhSiu0kLfqfQphvqmnfzg9A/edit?usp=sharing)
    * *An exploration of the procedural generation algorithms used to create dynamic scenarios and entities based on a core set of rules.*

* [**Case Study 5: Life Cycle Simulation**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1G2asZhIjdPlUG5sJB3o4I89nUMpfH9-SiIlqGMG2AbM/edit?usp=sharing)
    * *A case study on the simulation of multi-stage life cycle processes, modeling resource allocation, stress adaptation, and state transitions to validate long-term system viability.*

### Project: Chimera Aggregate
*Self-Directed | June 2022 â€“ Present*

This is a multi-year, self-directed research and development project to architect a complex, rule-based conceptual system from the ground up.

* **System Architecture & Documentation:** Architected a complex conceptual framework ('Chimera Aggregate') and authored over 2.47 million words of comprehensive technical documentation, including process flows and rule-set definitions.

* **Quality Assurance & Analysis:** Performed continuous QA on conceptual models to identify and resolve thousands of logical flaws and data continuity errors; conducted root cause analysis to trace systemic issues back to foundational rule conflicts.

* **System Design & Modeling:** Established a hierarchical rule-based system to ensure internal consistency. Developed a detailed data taxonomy to govern entity interactions and simulated multi-stage life cycles to validate long-term system stability.
